## Overview

DevQuote is built for quick syntax recall and deep technical comprehension. Instead of endlessly browsing forum threads or bloated documentation pages, you can search, copy, and inspect battle-tested one-liners and utility patterns in seconds.

Design principles:

- **Fast.** No framework, no runtime overhead. Vanilla HTML, CSS, and ES modules.
- **Focused.** Every snippet answers three questions: what does it do, why does it work, and what can go wrong.
- **Clean.** An obsidian dark theme, strict zero-emoji policy, and developer-first ergonomics.
- **Open.** Every snippet is an independent, validated JSON file that anyone can improve through a pull request.

## Features

### 3D Flippable Cards

| Face | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| **Front** | Domain badge, clean title, syntax box with prompt prefix, tag pills, and a one-click copy button |
| **Back** | Technical explanation, a "Caution" best-practices callout, alternative flags and variations table, and contributor credit |

### Instant Search and Filtering

- Global shortcut (`Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` or `/`) that indexes commands, titles, explanations, and tags
- Category tabs with real-time snippet counters
- Popular tag filter pills with multi-selection support
- Sorting by Featured, Title (A-Z), and Category

### Local Bookmarking

Star frequently used commands. Bookmarks persist in `localStorage`, so no account or backend is needed.

### Strict Zero-Emoji Aesthetics

A clean, professional UI built with minimalist geometric SVG icons and high-legibility typography (Inter and JetBrains Mono). The validator enforces this rule on every snippet.

### Modular Contribution Engine

Each snippet lives as an independent JSON file in `data/snippets/`. A schema validator and a build script keep the registry consistent, so contributions are easy to review and hard to break.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Core | Vanilla HTML5, modern CSS3 (variables, Grid, 3D transforms), ES6 modules |
| Tooling | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) 8.x |
| Build utilities | Node.js snippet compiler (`scripts/build-data.js`) and schema validator (`scripts/validate-snippets.js`) |
| Typography | Inter, JetBrains Mono |

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm 9.0 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DevQuote.git
cd DevQuote

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build     # outputs optimized static assets to dist/
npm run preview   # serves the production build locally
```

The output in `dist/` is fully static and can be hosted anywhere: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static file server.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the local Vite development server with hot module reload |
| `npm run build` | Compiles optimized static assets into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build locally |
| `npm run build:data` | Aggregates individual JSON files from `data/snippets/` into `data/snippets.json` |
| `npm run test:snippets` | Validates all snippet JSON files against schema rules and zero-emoji compliance |

## Snippet Format

Every snippet is a standalone JSON file in `data/snippets/`, named `<category>-<short-description>.json` (for example, `git-undo-last-commit.json`).

The example below is illustrative. The authoritative schema and validation rules live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```json
{
  "id": "git-undo-last-commit",
  "category": "Git",
  "title": "Undo the last commit, keep changes staged",
  "command": "git reset --soft HEAD~1",
  "tags": ["git", "undo", "commit"],
  "explanation": "Moves the branch pointer back one commit while leaving your working tree and index untouched.",
  "caution": "Do not rewrite history that has already been pushed to a shared branch.",
  "variations": [
    { "syntax": "git reset --mixed HEAD~1", "description": "Unstage the changes as well" },
    { "syntax": "git reset --hard HEAD~1", "description": "Discard the changes entirely" }
  ],
  "author": "your-github-handle"
}
```

## Contributing

DevQuote is open source and community driven. Because the project is maintained through version control, **all contributions are submitted as code via GitHub Pull Requests**. Direct web submissions are not used.

Quick contribution flow:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch: `git checkout -b snippet/docker-remove-dangling`
2. Add a new JSON file to `data/snippets/`
3. Validate it: `npm run test:snippets`
4. Rebuild the registry: `npm run build:data`
5. Commit, push, and open a Pull Request

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full JSON schema, validation requirements, and PR checklist.

### Good first contributions

- Add a snippet for a command you look up repeatedly
- Improve an existing explanation or add a missing "Caution" note
- Add alternative flags and variations to existing cards
- Fix typos or improve accessibility of the UI
- Add a new category (open an issue first to discuss)

### Contribution rules at a glance

- One snippet per file
- Snippets must pass `npm run test:snippets`
- No emojis anywhere in snippet content
- Commands should be correct, safe by default, and tested
- Explanations should be concise and technically accurate

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` | Focus the global search |
| `/` | Focus the global search |
| `Esc` | Clear search and blur the input |

## Roadmap

- [ ] More categories (Kubernetes, Bash, TypeScript)
- [ ] Shareable deep links to individual cards
- [ ] Export bookmarked snippets
- [ ] Light theme option
- [ ] Offline support via service worker
- [ ] Keyboard-only card navigation
